# PDS\_MODULE OFFSET Macro

**Parent topic:**[PDS Library Usage](GUID-A7B0958C-E476-48EA-9C30-DA83508CC577.md)

## C

```c
#define PDS_MODULE_APP_OFFSET      (1 << 12)
#define PDS_MODULE_BT_OFFSET       (1 << 13)
#define PDS_MODULE_ZB_OFFSET       (1 << 14)
#define PDS_MODULE_RES_OFFSET      (1 << 15)

```

## Description

These offsets CAN be used\(OR'ed\) to define the range and also to differentiate

the module specific IDs, so the same item ID will not be used across the stacksmodules.

The IDs ranges are required to maintain the backward compatibility during an SW upgrade

with newly added item\(s\) in any module.

Note: These offset were not used anywhere inside PDS implementation\(Library\).

This is purely to enable the application to use specific IDs across modules.
